# Scrum Explanation

This is an agile methodology to manage and plan a software project. With this method, we can develop any big projects by successive iterations, regardless the size of the our team.

Before explaining to you how this important current development tool works, I need show some fundamental concepts about it:

## Fundamental Concepts:

### > Sprint:

I think it's tha main concept, because all the things happen during a **sprint**, it presents a Time Box which a set of activities should be executed in two weeks or one month.

### > Product Owner:

He or she is the sole person who can manager the **Product Backlog** (it's explained below), it includes ordering the list of tasks by their priorities. Furthermore, this person is responsible to make that tasks clear for the **Scrum Team** (it'll be explained soon).

### > Product Backlog:

It is where are all the desired features/functionalities from the final product. These features in this place is defined by the **Product Owner** and he's responsible to order that features and to know how to explain each one so clearly for any person. In addition, it's important know that it can starts only with some features and over time to be filled with other functionalities.

### > Scrum Master:

This person is responsible to manager the team of programers (called Scrum Team). So, he or she has to have a comprehensive view about all the projects and take some important decisions, if needed. In Addition, that person has to ensure that her team are following the Scrum rules correctly.

### > Scrum Team:

They're people how are responsible for the development of the applications during the sprints and they're followed by their **Scrum Master**. So, if the Srum Team has a problem and they don't get fix it, usually they could ask for their Master about it. 

### > Sprint Backlog:

This represent all the tasks that will be implemented during the sprint. Those tasks are moved from **Product Backlog** to **Sprint Backlog** according with the **Product Owner** and the **Scrum Team**, because it knows more or less how much time is needed to do those tasks. In addition, the **Scrum Master** also is responsable for manage these tasks during the sprint. So he knows, according to **Sprint Burndown Chart**, how the sprint situation is going. 

### > Daily Scrum:

It's an important daily meeting where each member from the **Scrum Team** can report a basic status about his part of the project. Basically they can answer these three questions below:
* What did you do tomorrow ? 
* What are you going to do today ?
* There are some impediment ? 

So, all the Team can now understand what is happening in the **Sprint**.
